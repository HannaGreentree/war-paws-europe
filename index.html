            <h1>FROM SIRENS TO SAFETY</h1>
            <p>
              Russian aggression against Ukraine is the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.
              Animals are living in constant 
              danger — exposed to hunger, daily explosions, stress and cold.   
              Thousands of pets have lost their owners and live on strits now. 
              Many animals were left behind during evacuation, 
              while others were already living on the streets. There are animals that injured by Russian bullets 
              and need medical assistance. 
              By choosing to adopt a pet from a war zone, you are not only giving an animal a home — 
              you are giving them a chance to live.
            </p>

   <h1>THIS WEBSITE WAS CREATED BY VOLUNTEERS AND ANIMAL LOVERS</h1>
            <p>
              War Paws Europe was created by volunteers and animal lovers who want to make pet adoption and animal 
              transport clearer, safer, and more achievable.
              <p>This website was built by volunteers who care deeply about animals affected by war and displacement. 
              It has been four years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Many regions of 
              Ukraine are under daily shelling and missile attacks.
              <p>As people are forced to flee the country, many must leave their pets behind. Thousands of pet owners 
              have been killed, and countless animals are left on the streets to survive alone. There is little to no 
              food, constant danger from explosions, and extreme conditions. During harsh Ukrainian winters, 
              temperatures can drop to −20°C, leaving animals exposed to freezing cold, bombs, and ongoing destruction.

    <h1>WHO CAN FIND THIS WEBSITE USEFUL</h1>
            <p>
              If you ever though to adopt animal from a warzones. 
              This website is for people from different parts of the world who want to adopt animals from warzones 
              like Ukraine, as well as for Ukrainians who need guidance on how to travel safely with their own pets.
              <p>We bring together essential documents, trusted contacts, and real examples in one place. Many animals are 
              left behind during evacuations, and this platform focuses on practical steps, not just stories.
              <p>Through this website, we also aim to draw greater attention from animal protection organisations and 
              encourage them to speak more openly and consistently about the animal crisis in Ukraine. This is a 
              humanitarian and environmental tragedy that our planet has not witnessed on this scale for decades.
              <p>Human life is vital — and animal life matters too. We hope to inspire and engage more people who have 
              the influence to elevate the animal crisis in Ukraine to the highest level of attention, working through 
              organisations that may not be able to end the war, but can help reduce the suffering of animals caught in it.
